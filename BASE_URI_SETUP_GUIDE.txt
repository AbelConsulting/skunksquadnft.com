ü¶® SKUNK SQUAD NFT - BASE URI SETUP GUIDE
================================================================

CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS:
==========================
‚ùå Transaction ID "fjHKZi8HUJVkhPD6ft6JKn0nmymkaG5sFsgjv-DIpiw" NOT FOUND on Arweave
‚ùå Your local manifest file has placeholder transaction IDs
‚úÖ You have 10,000 image files uploaded to Arweave (confirmed in txid_mapping.csv)
‚ùì Status of metadata JSON files unclear

WHAT YOU NEED FOR A WORKING NFT COLLECTION:
==========================================

For each NFT (1-10000), you need:
1. ‚úÖ IMAGE uploaded to Arweave ‚Üí You HAVE these
2. ‚ùì METADATA JSON uploaded to Arweave ‚Üí Status UNKNOWN
3. ‚ùì MANIFEST file uploaded to Arweave ‚Üí NOT YET

OPTION 1: SIMPLE APPROACH - Direct Metadata Folder
==================================================
Instead of using a manifest, point directly to a folder of metadata:

1. Upload all your metadata JSON files (1.json, 2.json, ... 10000.json) to a single Arweave folder
2. Get that folder's transaction ID
3. Set base URI to: ar://FOLDER_TXID/
4. Your contract will access: ar://FOLDER_TXID/1.json, ar://FOLDER_TXID/2.json, etc.

To do this:
- Use ArDrive to upload the metadata folder
- Get the folder's Data Transaction ID from ArDrive
- That becomes your base URI

OPTION 2: MANIFEST APPROACH (More Complex)
===========================================
1. Upload all 10,000 metadata JSON files individually
2. Collect all their transaction IDs
3. Update folder_based_manifest_final.json with real TXIDs
4. Upload the completed manifest to Arweave
5. Use the manifest's transaction ID as your base URI

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
=======================

Step 1: Check if metadata files exist in ArDrive
------------------------------------------------
Go to: https://app.ardrive.io/
Navigate to drive: d558a9a5-3122-42ef-a215-ae9bddbef0ee
Look for a "metadata" folder

Step 2a: IF METADATA FOLDER EXISTS in ArDrive:
----------------------------------------------
1. Click on the metadata folder
2. Look for its "Data Transaction ID" or folder transaction
3. That ID becomes your base URI: ar://TXID/

Step 2b: IF NO METADATA FOLDER:
-------------------------------
You need to upload metadata first!

Check if metadata files exist locally:
PowerShell> Get-ChildItem -Path "metadata" -Filter "*.json" | Measure-Object

If they exist, upload them:
1. Create a "metadata" folder in ArDrive under your skunksquadnft folder
2. Upload all metadata JSON files (1.json through 10000.json)
3. Get the folder's transaction ID
4. Use that as your base URI

Step 3: Update Your Contract
-----------------------------
Once you have a valid transaction ID:

npx hardhat run scripts/update-contract-uri.js --network sepolia YOUR_VALID_TXID

TESTING YOUR BASE URI:
=====================
Before updating the contract, test the URI:

Test URL: https://arweave.net/YOUR_TXID/1
or: https://arweave.net/YOUR_TXID/metadata/1

It should return JSON like:
{
  "name": "Skunk Squad #1",
  "description": "...",
  "image": "ar://5G0kMdVLnocnhr_xk_xwBGGCdASv-OCIRItdvEFsJ90",
  "attributes": [...]
}

CURRENT CONTRACT STATUS:
========================
Contract Address: 0xBC00f05B9918B6B529d7edd33d89b4fB7016F6aF
Current Base URI: ar://0770a619-f2f1-4c59-9d1d-2fceb4a9294d/ (PLACEHOLDER)
Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS UPDATE WITH REAL TRANSACTION ID

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
==========================
1. Check ArDrive for metadata folder
2. If no metadata folder, upload metadata files first  
3. Get the valid Arweave transaction ID
4. Validate it works: https://arweave.net/TXID/1
5. Update contract with real transaction ID
