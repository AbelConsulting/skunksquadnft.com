ü¶® SKUNK SQUAD NFT - FINAL BASE URI SOLUTION
================================================================

‚úÖ GOOD NEWS: All 9,999 metadata files are uploaded to Arweave!
üìÑ CREATED: nft_manifest_ready.json with all transaction IDs mapped

FINAL STEPS TO GET YOUR BASE URI:
==================================

Step 1: Upload the Manifest to Arweave
---------------------------------------
Option A - Using ArDrive CLI (if installed):
```
ardrive upload-file --local-path "nft_manifest_ready.json" --parent-folder-id "094705ec-b852-455e-89f4-60b639676f74"
```

Option B - Using ArDrive Web Interface:
1. Go to: https://app.ardrive.io/
2. Navigate to your drive: d558a9a5-3122-42ef-a215-ae9bddbef0ee  
3. Go into the "skunksquadnft" folder
4. Click "Upload" ‚Üí Select "nft_manifest_ready.json"
5. Wait for upload to complete and confirm on Arweave

Step 2: Get the Manifest Transaction ID
----------------------------------------
After upload completes:
1. Click on "nft_manifest_ready.json" in ArDrive
2. Look for "Data Transaction ID" (43-character string)
3. Copy that transaction ID

Step 3: Validate the Transaction ID
------------------------------------
```powershell
python ardrive_helper.py YOUR_MANIFEST_TXID
```

It should show:
‚úÖ Transaction exists
‚úÖ Manifest detected  
‚úÖ Contains X paths

Step 4: Test the Manifest
--------------------------
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://arweave.net/YOUR_MANIFEST_TXID/1"
```

Should return JSON for NFT #1 with name, description, image, etc.

Step 5: Update Your Contract
-----------------------------
```powershell
npx hardhat run scripts/update-contract-uri.js --network sepolia YOUR_MANIFEST_TXID
```

This will set your base URI to: ar://YOUR_MANIFEST_TXID/

WHAT YOUR BASE URI WILL DO:
===========================
When someone views NFT #1, the contract returns:
‚Üí ar://YOUR_MANIFEST_TXID/1

Arweave resolves this to:
‚Üí https://arweave.net/2XMCXPnFopiCG1gztTN9Odej6DY57KpgXqNU8WVu-Qs

Which shows the metadata for token #1!

CURRENT STATUS:
===============
‚úÖ 10,000 images uploaded to Arweave  
‚úÖ 9,999 metadata JSON files uploaded to Arweave
‚ùå 1 metadata file missing (check which token ID)
‚è≥ Manifest file created but not yet uploaded
‚è≥ Contract has placeholder base URI

ABOUT THE TRANSACTION ID YOU PROVIDED:
======================================
fjHKZi8HUJVkhPD6ft6JKn0nmymkaG5sFsgjv-DIpiw

This transaction ID does NOT exist on Arweave. It may be:
- An ArDrive File-Id (not the same as Arweave TXID)
- A partial/incomplete transaction ID
- From a failed upload

You need to upload nft_manifest_ready.json and get a NEW transaction ID.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================
If you're missing metadata for one token:
```powershell
# Find which token is missing
python -c "import json; m=json.load(open('nft_manifest_ready.json')); print('Missing:', set(range(1,10001)) - set(int(k) for k in m['paths'].keys()))"
```

Once you have the correct manifest TXID, your NFT collection will be fully functional!
