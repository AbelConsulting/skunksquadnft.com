ü¶® SKUNK SQUAD NFT - FINDING YOUR ARWEAVE TRANSACTION ID
================================================================

You've provided ArDrive File metadata, but we need the ARWEAVE DATA TRANSACTION ID.

üìã YOUR ARDRIVE FILE INFO:
- File-Id: e93d706d-678e-4d3a-bb85-028ab83dee6c
- Drive-Id: d558a9a5-3122-42ef-a215-ae9bddbef0ee
- Parent-Folder-Id: 094705ec-b852-455e-89f4-60b639676f74

üîç HOW TO FIND THE CORRECT TRANSACTION ID:

Option 1: ArDrive Web Interface (EASIEST)
==========================================
1. Go to: https://app.ardrive.io/
2. Navigate to your drive: d558a9a5-3122-42ef-a215-ae9bddbef0ee
3. Find your manifest file (likely named something like "folder_based_manifest_final.json")
4. Click on the file to open its details
5. Look for one of these fields:
   - "Data Transaction ID" or "Data TX ID"
   - "Arweave Transaction"
   - A 43-character alphanumeric string (NOT the File-Id)
6. Copy that transaction ID

Option 2: Use ArDrive CLI
==========================================
If you have ArDrive CLI installed:

ardrive file-info --file-id e93d706d-678e-4d3a-bb85-028ab83dee6c

Look for the "dataTxId" field in the output.

Option 3: Check Arweave Block Explorer
==========================================
1. Go to: https://viewblock.io/arweave
2. Search for your File-Id: e93d706d-678e-4d3a-bb85-028ab83dee6c
3. Look for associated transactions
4. Find the one with Entity-Type: file and Content-Type: application/json

üìå WHAT THE TRANSACTION ID SHOULD LOOK LIKE:
============================================
‚úÖ CORRECT: 43 characters, alphanumeric with hyphens and underscores
   Example: CP7hoS7Dpke7RXxnTmosH6N3P3_-adXN2NFaIhw54do

‚ùå WRONG: UUID format (with dashes in specific positions)
   Example: e93d706d-678e-4d3a-bb85-028ab83dee6c (this is File-Id)

‚ùå WRONG: Longer than 43 characters or shorter than 43 characters
   Example: fjHKZi8HUJVkhPD6ft6JKn0nmymkaG5sFsgjv-DIpiw3 (44 chars)

üöÄ ONCE YOU HAVE THE CORRECT TRANSACTION ID:
=============================================

1. Validate it:
   python ardrive_helper.py YOUR_TRANSACTION_ID

2. Update your contract:
   npx hardhat run scripts/update-contract-uri.js --network sepolia YOUR_TRANSACTION_ID

3. Verify the update:
   npx hardhat run scripts/check-current-uri.js --network sepolia

üìû STILL STUCK?
===============
Share a screenshot of your ArDrive file details page showing the transaction information,
or export the file details and share the complete metadata.

The transaction ID we're looking for was created when ArDrive uploaded your manifest
file to Arweave. It's the permanent storage address for your metadata.
